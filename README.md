When I think of my home town, I think of all the road work and construction projects that take forever to finish. In this game, you assume the role of a rogue cement mixer, taking revenge on all of your co-workers for a job not well done. You shoot out cement projectiles from the back of your vehicle, and can jump with `space` and sprint with `shift` due to your immense pent-up frustration.
